String vs String Buffer:                      String                                                String Buffer
                                                                                  
                            1) Strings are immutable.                             |   1) String Buffer are mutable

                               allowed to perfrom any changes in that object.     |
                               And if we apply any changes in that string new     |
                               object will be created but we are not allowed      |
                               assign any reference variable after applying       |
                               changes. So, acts as a garbage.                    |

                               same object means we can use the same object       |        Every object has seperate area.

== v/s equals :               ==   ->   It is refernce comparison. If both are pointing to same object than it will return true.
                              equals->  equals is a method in object class which is also for reference comparison.
                                        In string class, equals method is overriden for content comparison. But in string Buffer acts as a reference comparison.

                              System.out.println(s1.equals(s2));  // true         |     System.out.println(sb1.equals(sb2));    // false
                              
                              ==-> refernce comparison
                              equals-> in string class ->content compression 
                                        in string buffer-> refernce comparison.

Note:   1)In Heap-> using new keyword object is created in heap memory or for any run time operation change value go into heap values.
        2)In SCP-> for every string literals,one object is created in SCP(String Pool Constant) area. But it will check wheteher that object is present or not. 
                   If it is present than no new object will be created the same object will be used otherwise new object is created.
                   So need of SCP is to use the same object for future purpose.

Advantages of SCP->   1) same reference can be refrenced with multiple objects.So same object can be used multiple time instead of creating new object.
                      2) So, memory utilization is improved.

Problem with SCP->    Lets take an example of voting system for understanding the problems in SCP. suppose there are 'n' voters in the city hyderabad. 
                      So, city hyderabad is same for all the voters. So , we can use the same object multiple time according to SCP.But what if suppose one of
                      the voter change the city from hyderabad to lucknow. And if we change the value it will also refleced in the remaining voters to luknow
                      as they are also referenced to it. So , that's why immutable concept occur.
                      So, if we want to chnage the object than new object is created but change in that is not allowed. So, that user new object is created as 
                      Lucknow and that user refernced to that value.

Ques? Why Strings in java is immutable? Beacuse of SCP concept.
Ques? Why String are mutable but String buffer is immutable? String is most commonly used in java. So that is why they provided special management for string but we 
      use string Buffer very rarely that's why memory management is not required in string buffer.
Ques?
