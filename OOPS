OOP's (Object Orientd Programming)
It is a programming paradigm means way of doing things. 6 main pillars of OOP are Class,Object,Inheritance,Polymorphism,Abstraction,Encapsulation.
Small Talk is truely oop language.
So OOP is a methodology to design a program using classes and object.

Object->        instance of class. means real world entities such as dog,cat etc. 

Class ->        collection of objects. It is not real world entity. It is just a prototype from which you can create an individual object.For example animal is class.

Inheritance->   When one object acquires all the properties and behaviour of a parent object is called inheritance.
                It provides code reusability.

Polymorphism->  If one task is performed in a different ways it is known as polymorhism. For example to convince the coustmer differently. Another example like speaking
                something like dog barks and cat meows.
                Over-Loading and Over-riding concept is there.
Abstraction->   Hiding internal details and showing functionality only known as abstraction.For example phone call , we dont know internal processing of it.

Data Hiding->   In encapsulation, the variables of a class will be hidden from other classes, and can be accessed only through the methods of their current class. 
                Therefore, it is also known as data hiding

Encapsulation-> Process of Grouping datamembers and corresponding method into a sinhle unit is Encapsulation. Every java class is an example of encapsulation. For 
                example if there is a student it has name,age,roll_no, marks. Also he can do study, dance. So, all these things into an single class is encapsulation.
                Encapsulation=Data-hiding+ abstraction.
                So, if any data follows data hiding and abstraction it is encasulation.
                How we can achieve it?-> declare data member as a private  and use it n the getter and setter method.And that methods can be access through GUI By which 
                we can have directly access to the method. So making private(Data hiding) and using gui(Abstraction) both we can achieve encapsulation.
                Advantages: 1) Security     2)Maintaining easy      
                Disadvantage: 1) Performance goes down as for every data member we need to provide getter and setter method.
                
if one method is abstract than class is also abstract.
