Language used-> Java
Concept used-> Swing and Java Networking(Socket Programming)
Description:
This is a simple chatting or server-client application. In which one is a server and other is client. They can communicate with each other.
So one to one communication is there.
Framing is done using swing and socket prgraming(concept of network programming) is used for communication.

Coding:
inside the constructor ,I am doing the frame coding.
Jframe is the class
And swing is the packkage name.
Function : Setsize is the function inside the Jframe class. And we have to use setVisible(true  ) function to see them on screen. Because setsize create the frame but 
not shown in the screen.


Socket Programming is used for communication between the different applications.   

Talking about the modification part, if client is typing than the staus will change from Active now to typing as seen in whatsapp.
So, for changing the statis i have used timer class here.
